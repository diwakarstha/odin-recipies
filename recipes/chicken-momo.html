The main goal is to make sure, you conceal the edges of the dough patties together so no meat comes out. For more help, you can look up videos of instructions or you can use your own creativity. That’s the fun part of making Momo. Invite your guests to be part of it too. </li>
            <li>Boil water in Momo steamer. Once the water comes to a boil, add Momo on top shelf of the steamer. Steam the Momo for at least 15 minutes and not more than 20 minutes on high heat. </li>
            <li>For the sauce, chop tomatoes into smaller pieces. Fry it in hot pan with olive oil. Add cumin powder and sesame seed, garlic, ginger, green chili (if prefer hot) and salt according to your liking. In about 10 minutes of cooking take it out; let it sit for 5 minutes. Then grind it in a grinder. </li>
